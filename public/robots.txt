# Sitemap helps crawlers discover all routes fast
Sitemap: https://www.writtenlyhub.com/sitemap_index.xml

# Notes:
# - This SPA serves client-side routes; allowing "/" covers all paths like /{category}/{slug}.
# - Manage URL parameters (e.g., UTM) via canonical tags and Search Console rather than blocking with robots.
# - For non-production environments, deploy a separate robots.txt that disallows all.
